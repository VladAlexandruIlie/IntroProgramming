Hey Troels, 

The program can be run by running the jar file in a command prompt. 
using the command: "java -jar DinnerPlanner.jar" will start the command line interface.
After that type "help" for a list of valid command that the program can perform. 

The valid commands are the following: "show ingredients", "add ingredients", "show grocery list",
 "set servings", "assign recipe to weekday", "rate dish", "show ratings", "show weekly plan", 
 "random dinner", "help" and "quit"

all the recipes are stored in the "\DinnerPlanner\recipes" folder
you can add / remove files into that folder

In my opinion, the biggest difference is that my program shows the list of ingredients in
milliliters and grams (rpunded up to the closest multiple of 10) instead of all of those 
weird american units :)) 

in addition to this, the program: 
	allows a user to set the number of servings and it will resize all ingredient quantities
	merges ingrdients lists from different recipes without creating duplicates or items with 
different unit types
	allows the user to assign a receipt to an individual day 
	allows the user to print a weekly plan (if days are not set, they will nto eb shown)
	allows users to rate dishes
	allows users to sort teh rated dishes in a descending manner
	users can let the program randomly choose a dinner plan.
	
Best regards,
Vlad Alexandru Ilie
